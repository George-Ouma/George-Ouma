Hello there,
My name is George Ouma and I am from Nairobi, Kenya. I am a self-taught python programmer with a strong background in economics. 
I've been passionate about programming for a long time, whic is to say that I kinda regret not pursuing it in university. 
Programming provides me with the woonderful opportunity to dream up ideas and utilize the available interfaces to make them come to fruition. 

Interacting with others on the same journey has and continues to teach me a great deal through collaboration and the sharing of knowledge and information through open-source.
